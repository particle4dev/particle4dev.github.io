**How to build a career in tech**

- What Should You Do With Your Life?

At some point, just about all of us ask this question:

What should I do with my life?

Many of the most successful people you can think of asked them selves the very same thing — and they now have great advice on the topic after having carved their own unique path to where they are today.

- The Best & Worst Career Advice I’ve Ever Received

Whether we want it or not, we’re bound to get alot of career advice over the course of ourlives. Some of it will stick with us forever — and some of it won’t resonate at all. The Product Hunt community has asked dozens of LIVE Chat guests about the best and worst career advice they’ve ever received. Here’s what some of them shared with us.

### The Best Career Advice I’ve Ever Received

**Write your future resume:**

_Jonathan Rosenberg, former SVP of Product at Google, used to ask all the PMs on his team to write their resume in 10 years. Where do you want to be? I was skeptical until I did it. I realized pretty quickly that my
resume in 10 years didn’t say “CEO.” I didn’t want to be a CEO. But I hadn’t explicitly stated that, and in
many ways the PM career path defaults to the CEO career path. Knowing I wanted something different helped me be more deliberate about my career decisions and communicating my goals to others._

**Know your strengths:**

_My dad has consistently told me: “just do your best” — which actually is quite a challenging piece of advice because I always feel like I can be doing better! I have also received a lot of advice to focus on my strengths, and try to find a path that enables me to express them. For me, VC has been a better “fit” than
anything I've done to date — and I think it was my focus on finding a role where I could put myself to my “best
use” that helped me find this career path._
